This folder contains derived datasets that are small, but needed for previewing of styles.
An example is the magnitude of the average current. This is represented as u and v in the 
eReefs data, but is converted to magnitude using sqrt(u^2+v^2) in QGIS. Since this data
is small we save it in the code repo for convenience.
